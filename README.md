Alarm To-Do List Application
Overview
The Alarm To-Do List is a simple yet interactive web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks and receive timely reminders. Built with React.js and custom CSS, it offers a clean interface for task organization and a visually engaging user experience.

Features
Task Management: Easily add new tasks, specifying a description, a time, and a date for completion.

Task Deletion: Remove tasks from the list once they are completed or no longer needed.

Real-time Clock: Displays the current time, updating every second, providing a live reference.

Intelligent Reminders: Triggers both a visual alert and an audible voice reminder (using the Web Speech API) when a task's scheduled time and date arrive.

Dynamic Background: Features an animated background with moving "balls" and a vibrant radial gradient for a unique visual flair.

Intuitive Interface: Input fields and buttons are styled for clarity and ease of use, with modern aesthetics including rounded corners, shadows, and interactive hover/active states.

Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

JavaScript (ES6+): For core application logic and Web Speech API integration.

CSS: Custom styling for all visual elements, including gradients, animations, and responsive layouts.

Web Speech API: For text-to-speech functionality to provide audible reminders.

How to Run the Project Locally
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You will need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Node.js (includes npm)

Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable):

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>


(Replace <your-repository-url> and <your-repository-name> with your actual repository details if you've hosted it on GitHub/GitLab/etc.)

Create a new React project (if you don't have one already):
If you're starting from scratch or integrating this into an existing project:

npx create-react-app my-todo-app
cd my-todo-app


Place the Todoo.jsx file:
Copy the Todoo.jsx file into the src/ directory of your React project.

Update App.js (or your main component file):
Modify src/App.js (or src/index.js) to render the Todoo component. For example:

// src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import Todoo from './Todoo'; // Adjust path if Todoo.jsx is in a subfolder
import './App.css'; // If you have a global CSS file, otherwise remove

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Todoo />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the development server:

npm start


This will open the application in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
